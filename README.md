# aA-solving_recursion_problems

A series of practice problems on using recursion to solve problems with JavaScript, in partial fulfillment of the AAO curriculum.

## Instructions

Here we `go(go(go()))`! It's time to flex your coding muscles on recursion. For each problem, implement a recursive function that satisfies all the listed requirements. Iterative solutions will be considered incorrect. The problems aren't dependent on each other and may be completed in any order you wish.

As you complete each problem, use mocha to test your solutions. Make sure you're in the project's root: you should be in the same place as the problems/ and test/ directories. Once there, run the following command:

```
> mocha
```

We know you've got this!
